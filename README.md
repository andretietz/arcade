# Building an arcade machine

## 1. The Arcade Cabinet

This was actually a bigger issue than I thought it would. As far as I could see, there was [just one
open project](http://www.koenigs.dk/mame/eng/draw.htm) online which provided a plan to build the
cabinet. Basically everyone, who's creating it's own cabinet, is using this plan more less. I
thought there should be more variety and created this Open Project. Feel free to use every template
as you want. A good thing would be if your result differs, provide it here too. Create a Pull request in which you add your sketch file into this repository. (Or send it to me directly so that I can provide it for you) 

ATM you can find a Sketch Up file which is still under development, where I create my first cabinet.
I got inspired by [robotron2048guidebook.com](http://www.robotron2084guidebook.com/technical/gameplatforms/arcade-cabinet-silhouettes-and-shapes/).
They provide a whole list of old arcade cabinet shapes.
