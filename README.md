# Building an arcade machine

## 1. The Arcade Cabinet

This was actually a bigger issue thant I thought it would. As far as I could see, there was (just one
open project)[http://www.koenigs.dk/mame/eng/draw.htm] online which provided a plan to build the
cabinet. Basically everyone, who's creating it's own cabinet, is using this plan more less. I
thought there should be more variety and created this Open Project. Feel free to use every template
as you want, just make sure you create a pull request in this repository to share your results if
they differ.

ATM you can find a Sketch Up file which is still under development, where I create my first cabinet.
I got inspired by (robotron2048guidebook.com)[http://www.robotron2084guidebook.com/technical/gameplatforms/arcade-cabinet-silhouettes-and-shapes/].
They provide a whole list of old arcade cabinet shapes.
